Echo Care

The goal of our project is to offer assistance to geriatric nurses via Amazon Echo Dot to do the following:

-Wake up patients
-Remind patients to take medicine
-Support ability to contact nurse if needed
-Provide Accessible content to users, including weather data, time, and any reminders they may have set for the day
